Dear Sir/Madam,  
I would like to introduce myself, my name is Nathan Layt. I am an Australian citizen living locally in Goodna. I am able to use public transport and have full time availability. I am seeking future employment opportunities within a company such as yours where I can use my current skills and learn on the job to meet and exceed my employerâ€™s expectations.

With years of experience in advanced computer skills, logistics and sales experience working for Foxtel, working without supervision and completing tasks with high attention to detail. I have developed a good and strong work ethic, I am fit and healthy and ready for the challenges that new employment will offer. I am currently doing part time study to increase my knowledge and keep up to date with my IT skills. This study can be flexible.

Thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter and resume, I can be contacted at the above email address to answer any further questions you may have or to attend an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely

Nathan Layt
